  We dropped a mountain of information about all the exciting changes coming to Hearthstone alongside today’s patch notes, including a deep dive into the game’s first-ever new class—the Demon Hunter!

Ashes of Outland brings Hearthstone players to the memorable setting of World of Warcraft’s first expansion, The Burning Crusade, only to find it has been razed by an unstoppable force for destruction known as the Rusted Legion.
